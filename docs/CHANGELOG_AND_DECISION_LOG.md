# Changelog & Decision Log — kriegerdataforge-cicd

Append-only Architecture Decision Records (`D-NNN`) for this repo, the home of the ecosystem CI/CD
automation and the canonical **agentic-workflow kit** (`kit/common/`). ADRs are immutable: to change
a decision, add a new one that supersedes it — don't edit history.

## D-001 — Agentic-Workflow Standard v1.1: vision-propagation, ambition ethos, contract-ownership

- **Date:** 2026-06-27
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Tier / scope:** Epic · repos: all (kit synced from `cicd/kit/common/`)
- **Design doc:** the multi-agent review of the kit (session `wm62gt0vf`) · **Epic tracker:**
  [`kriegerdataforge/docs/epics/agent-kit-distribution.md`](https://github.com/Needless2Say/kriegerdataforge/blob/main/docs/epics/agent-kit-distribution.md)

**Context.** A 7-dimension adversarial review of the agentic-workflow kit (graded B+) found it steers
a capable model well but leaves the owner's two stated priorities to luck: (1) a model on a cross-repo
task read only its *starting* repo's vision and treated the others as code to map; (2) nothing in the
kit licensed ambition, so the conservative default tone ("keep it scoped") nudged models toward timid
minimal patches. Three sharper gaps: the contract-first sequence hard-coded `backend → SDK → frontend`,
which is wrong for per-app APIs (the SDK is auth-only; per-app contracts flow backend-OpenAPI →
frontend client); Claude-only mechanisms (`/code-review ultra`, sub-agents, a hub-only `prompts/` link)
were stated without a provider-neutral fallback; and the template repos — the seed for every future
repo — had no Vision section and pointer files that never routed to `AGENTS.md`.

**Decision.** Ship **Standard v1.1** as additive, byte-identical kit edits plus one new flagship doc:

- **Vision-first across the blast radius** — Discovery now requires reading *every* touched repo's
  `AGENTS.md` Vision & Critical rules before designing; conflicts are escalated to the owner, never
  resolved silently. A per-repo vision table is now a fill-in field in the design-spec and
  epic-tracker templates (the artifact forces the thought).
- **"Aim high, then ship it safely"** — an explicit ethos: unrestricted in *what* you propose,
  disciplined in *how* you land it. Ambition belongs in the plan (as a proposal), restraint in the diff.
- **Contract ownership** — "define each contract in the repo that owns it"; auth/JWT in the SDK,
  per-app APIs via the backend's OpenAPI-generated (read-only) client.
- **Provider-neutral requirements** — adversarial review and parallelism are required *outcomes*; the
  Claude-specific mechanisms are optional accelerants with a manual fallback.
- **A new [`AGENT_OPERATING_STANDARD.md`](../kit/common/docs/agent/AGENT_OPERATING_STANDARD.md)** — the
  human-readable standard with worked examples from a one-line fix to an ecosystem-spanning epic, a
  contract-ownership map, a prompting guide, and a glossary. Added to the synced kit (`KIT_VERSION`
  → v1.1.0).
- **Template repairs** — all four `kriegerdataforge-template-*` repos' pointer files now route to
  `AGENTS.md`, and their `AGENTS.md` carries a fill-in Vision stub, so generated repos are born inside
  the workflow loop with a vision to write.

**Alternatives considered.**

- *Per-repo paths-ignore / leave as-is* — rejected: the gaps are in the kit *content*, not the engine.
- *Inject the kit into `issue-create-repo.yml` at generate time* — superseded (D-001 in the hub log):
  templates are sync targets, so `/generate` is born current without editing the privileged workflow.

**Trade-offs.** The kit grows (one new doc, longer Discovery/contract sections) — accepted, because the
cost of a vision-misaligned cross-repo design dwarfs a few paragraphs of reading. The edits are additive
and byte-identical-safe, so the distribution engine fans them out as ordinary review-gated PRs.

**Consequences.** Bump `kit/KIT_VERSION` → v1.1.0 and run the **Distribute** workflow to propagate. cicd
is sync-excluded, so its root-level kit copies are updated in this same change. Future kit edits must
keep `AGENT_OPERATING_STANDARD.md` consistent with the operational files (the doc defers to them on
conflict). The contract-ownership rule and the identity-decoupling FK split (hub FK vs tenant plain
`user_id`) are now invariants every cross-repo design must respect.
